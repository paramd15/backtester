"""Trend indicator re-export module.

Historically the project referenced ``backtesting_framework.indicators.trend``
while most implementations live in ``basic_trend.py``.  To maintain backwards
compatibility without duplicating code, this stub simply re-exports everything
from ``basic_trend``.
